scripts to help with troubleshooting and other useful tasks. 

FindAllErrors.bat - updated 9 NOV 2023 
USAGE:

Place the file in your install directory or drag and drop your Cyberpunk 2077 folder on top of the .bat file.
The script will dig through the folder for all relevant log files, extracting any error messages and printing them to a new file called "FilteredLogs" in the "_LOGS" folde generated in the Cyberpunk directory.
